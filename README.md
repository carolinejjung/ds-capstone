# Capstone Project: Predicting Membership Status of Blue Bike Trips
As bike share is a form of public transportation that promotes sustainability, this project aims to identify patterns related to bike usage and membership status for the city of Cambridge in hopes to suggest possible actions to increase membership from users and improve marketing tactics. The research asks, "how can we best predict the membership status for Blue Bike trips taken within Cambridge in 2024 based on rider & trip attributes?" I propose two models (classification tree based on bagging and logistic regression selected by AIC criterion) to the city. Overall, both models suggest that in 2024, trips were more likely to be taken by members if trips were shorter, taken in January, and started/ended at stations with more docks.
